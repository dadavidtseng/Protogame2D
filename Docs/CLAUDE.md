# Documentation Module

**Changelog**
- *2025-09-22 13:29:24* - Initial documentation: Simple README structure identified, recommended for expansion with technical details

## Module Responsibilities

The Docs module contains project documentation including the basic README file. Currently minimal, this module serves as the foundation for comprehensive project documentation and could be expanded to include technical specifications, API documentation, and development guides.

### Core Responsibilities
- **Project Overview**: Basic project introduction and description
- **Documentation Hub**: Central location for all project documentation
- **Development Guides**: Potential location for setup and development instructions
- **API Reference**: Future home for engine and game API documentation

## Entry and Startup

### Current Documentation
- **README.md**: Basic project title "# Protogame2D"
- **Content**: Minimal - contains only the project name header
- **Status**: Requires significant expansion for comprehensive project documentation

## External Interfaces

### Documentation Access
- **Primary File**: `README.md` - Entry point for project documentation
- **Integration**: Referenced in main project file (`Game.vcxproj`) as documentation item
- **Format**: Markdown for cross-platform compatibility and GitHub integration

## Key Dependencies and Configuration

### Documentation Standards
- **Format**: Markdown (.md) files for universal compatibility
- **Structure**: Hierarchical organization with clear navigation
- **Audience**: Developers, contributors, and potential users

### Current Gaps
The documentation module currently lacks:
1. **Setup Instructions**: How to build and run the project
2. **Architecture Overview**: High-level system design
3. **API Documentation**: Engine and game class interfaces
4. **Development Workflow**: Contribution guidelines and practices
5. **Asset Creation**: Guidelines for creating shaders, fonts, and audio

## Data Models

### Recommended Documentation Structure
```
Docs/
├── README.md                    # Project overview and quick start
├── ARCHITECTURE.md              # System design and patterns
├── BUILD.md                     # Build instructions and requirements
├── API/                         # API reference documentation
│   ├── Engine.md               # Engine subsystem APIs
│   └── Game.md                 # Game-specific APIs
├── DEVELOPMENT.md               # Development workflow and guidelines
└── ASSETS.md                   # Asset creation and management
```

### Content Recommendations
1. **Technical Specifications**: DirectX 11 usage, C++ standards, dependencies
2. **Architecture Documentation**: Engine-game separation, event system design
3. **API References**: Class interfaces, function signatures, usage examples
4. **Development Setup**: Visual Studio configuration, build requirements
5. **Asset Pipeline**: Shader authoring, font creation, audio integration

## Testing and Quality

### Documentation Quality Metrics
- **Completeness**: Coverage of all major system components
- **Accuracy**: Up-to-date information matching current codebase
- **Clarity**: Clear explanations suitable for target audience
- **Examples**: Code samples and usage demonstrations

### Recommended Testing
1. **Link Validation**: Ensure all internal and external links work
2. **Code Examples**: Verify all code samples compile and run
3. **Setup Verification**: Test build instructions on clean systems
4. **Review Process**: Regular updates to match codebase changes

## FAQ

### Q: Why is the current README so minimal?
A: The project appears to be in early development or educational phase. Comprehensive documentation is typically added as the project matures and external collaboration increases.

### Q: What documentation should be prioritized?
A: Start with build instructions and basic architecture overview, then expand to API documentation and development guidelines as the project grows.

### Q: Should documentation be integrated with code?
A: Consider using code comments for API documentation that can be extracted with tools like Doxygen, while keeping high-level design documentation in markdown files.

### Q: How should the documentation handle the external Engine dependency?
A: Document the interface between game and engine clearly, noting which functionality is provided by the external engine vs. implemented in the game layer.
